        <h1>Privacy Policy for Dexicon Chrome Extension</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date of Last
            Revision]</p>

        <p>Welcome to Dexicon! This Privacy Policy explains how Dexicon ("we,"
            "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in
            relation to our Chrome browser extension (the "Service"). By
            installing and using Dexicon, you agree to the collection and use of
            information in accordance with this policy.</p>
        <p>This policy is designed to comply with the Google Chrome Web Store
            Program Policies.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve
            our Service:</p>
        <h3>a. Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> When you sign up for an account,
                start a trial, or subscribe to Dexicon through our payment
                partner, ExtensionPay, your email address is collected to create
                and manage your account, process payments, and communicate with
                you about your subscription. Your email is also used in
                conjunction with your API key to authenticate your requests to
                our backend service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>b. Financial and Payment Information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> We receive information
                from ExtensionPay regarding your subscription status (e.g.,
                active, trial, expired), plan type, and renewal or expiry dates.
                This is necessary to provide you with the appropriate level of
                service.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Dexicon uses ExtensionPay
                (<a href="https://extensionpay.com" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">https://extensionpay.com</a>) for
                all payment processing. <strong>We do not directly collect,
                    store, or have access to your full credit card numbers or
                    detailed payment account information.</strong> This
                information is handled directly by ExtensionPay, which has its
                own privacy policy and security practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Authentication Information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Key (<code>extensionpay_api_key</code>):</strong>
                When you subscribe or start a trial, an API key is generated by
                ExtensionPay and stored by the Dexicon extension. This key is
                used to authenticate your access to premium features and to
                validate your requests to our backend service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>d. Website Content (User-Selected Text):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selected Text and Surrounding Passage:</strong> For the
                core functionality of providing contextual explanations, Dexicon
                collects the text you select on a webpage and the surrounding
                passage of text. This content is sent to our secure backend
                service to generate relevant definitions and AI-powered
                explanations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>e. User Activity (Related to Extension Use):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interactions with Dexicon:</strong> We process
                information about your interactions with the Dexicon extension
                itself, such as which features you use (e.g., Dictionary Mode
                vs. AI Mode, specific AI response types), your customized
                settings (font, theme, shortcuts), text selections made for
                definition lookup, clicks within the Dexicon bubble or popup,
                and mouse/scroll position used to place the explanation bubble.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong> If you use keyboard
                shortcuts to activate Dexicon's features, we process those
                specific key combinations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>f. Location Information (Limited):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> When the Dexicon extension
                communicates with our backend service (hosted on Cloudflare
                Workers), your IP address is automatically received by the
                server as part of standard internet communication. This may be
                used for general analytical purposes (e.g., aggregated regional
                usage) and for security measures like rate limiting or abuse
                prevention. We do not use it to precisely track your location.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>g. Extension Settings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your preferences for Dexicon, such as theme choice, font
                settings, AI mode enablement, and custom keyboard shortcuts, are
                stored locally using <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> and are
                synced across your signed-in Chrome browsers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Collect Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Directly from You:</strong> When you provide your email
                for an account/trial via ExtensionPay, or when you configure
                settings within the Dexicon popup.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatically When You Use the Service:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you select text on a webpage for definition.</li>
                    <li>When the extension makes requests to our backend service
                        (IP address, API key, selected text).</li>
                    <li>When you interact with the Dexicon interface (bubble,
                        popup).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>From Our Payment Partner (ExtensionPay):</strong> We
                receive your email address and subscription status from
                ExtensionPay.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes, aligned
            with Dexicon's single purpose of providing contextual explanations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authenticate your access to premium features using your
                        email and API key.</li>
                    <li>Process your selected text and surrounding passage to
                        generate definitions and AI explanations.</li>
                    <li>Display explanations in the Dexicon bubble according to
                        your personalized settings.</li>
                    <li>Manage your account and subscription status.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember your settings (theme, fonts, shortcuts) across
                        sessions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>To Communicate With You:</strong>

                    <li>Send important notices regarding your subscription,
                        service updates, or changes to our terms or policies
                        (primarily via ExtensionPay's platform or the email you
                        provided to them).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Security and Stability:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protect against, investigate, and deter fraudulent,
                        unauthorized, or illegal activity.</li>

                        services.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or transfer your personal data to third parties except
            in the limited circumstances described below, which are essential
            for providing the Dexicon service:</p>
        <h3>a. ExtensionPay:</h3>
        <p>We share your API key with ExtensionPay to validate your
            subscription. ExtensionPay collects your email and payment details
            directly to process payments and manage your subscription. We
            encourage you to review ExtensionPay's privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>b. Cloudflare Workers (Our Backend Infrastructure):</h3>
        <p>Your selected text, surrounding passage, email, and API key are sent
            to our backend service hosted on Cloudflare Workers. This service
            processes your request, validates your subscription, and (for AI
            features) forwards necessary data to an AI service provider.
            Cloudflare may log IP addresses for security and operational
            purposes.</p>

        <h3>c. OpenAI (AI Service Provider via Cloudflare AI Gateway):</h3>
        <p>For AI-powered features (Contextual Explanation, Etymology, Author's
            Intent, AI-selected dictionary definitions), the selected text and
            surrounding passage are sent from our Cloudflare Worker to OpenAI's
            API via Cloudflare's AI Gateway. We only send the text content
            necessary to generate the explanation. Your email or API key is not
            directly sent to OpenAI by us; our worker authenticates you before
            making its own authorized call to OpenAI. The use of data by OpenAI
            is governed by their policies.</p>

        <h3>d. Legal Compliance and Protection:</h3>
        <p>We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the
            good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
            legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent
            fraud, act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
            users of the Service, or protect against legal liability.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your extension settings,
                including your <code>extensionpay_api_key</code>, are stored
                locally in your browser using <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backend Storage:</strong> Our Cloudflare Worker may
                temporarily cache API key validation status (linked to email) in
                Cloudflare KV storage to improve performance and efficiency.
                Selected text and passages are processed in memory and are not
                permanently stored by our worker beyond what is necessary for
                the immediate request to OpenAI and response to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement reasonable
                security measures to protect your information from unauthorized
                access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no
                internet-based site or system can be 100% secure, so we cannot
                guarantee absolute security. Data is transmitted to our backend
                using HTTPS.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extension Settings:</strong> Stored locally as long as
                the extension is installed or until you clear them.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information (via ExtensionPay):</strong> Your
                email and subscription details are managed by ExtensionPay
                according to their data retention policies. If you delete your
                ExtensionPay account, your information will be handled by them.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare Worker Data:</strong> IP logs may be retained
                by Cloudflare for a limited period for security and analytics.
                Cached API key validation status is set with an expiration time
                (e.g., 1 hour). Selected text data is ephemeral.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessing and Correcting Your Information:</strong> You
                can manage your subscription details, including your email
                address, through the ExtensionPay platform. You can modify your
                Dexicon settings (themes, fonts, shortcuts) directly within the
                extension popup.</li>
            <li><strong>Disabling the Extension:</strong> You can disable or
                uninstall Dexicon at any time through your browser's extension
                management page. Disabling it for a specific tab is a core
                feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Deleting Your Data:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To delete your <code>extensionpay_api_key</code> and
                        locally stored settings, you can clear the extension's
                        storage or uninstall the extension.</li>
                    <li>To delete your account and associated data held by
                        ExtensionPay (email, subscription history), you will
                        need to follow ExtensionPay's account deletion
                        procedures.</li>
                    <li>Data passed to OpenAI is subject to OpenAI's policies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Dexicon is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a
            higher age threshold if applicable in your jurisdiction). We do not
            knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we
            become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
            information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
            you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the
            extension or on our website/listing page and updating the "Last
            Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
            periodically for any changes.</p>
